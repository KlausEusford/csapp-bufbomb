# csapp-bufbomb
This assignment helps you develop a detailed understanding of the calling stack organization on an IA32 processor. It involves applying a series of buffer overflow attacks on an executable file bufbomb in the lab directory.  Note: In this lab, you will gain firsthand experience with one of the methods commonly used to exploit security weaknesses in operating systems and network servers. Our purpose is to help you learn about the runtime operation of programs and to understand the nature of this form of security weakness so that you can avoid it when you write system code. We do not condone the use of these or any other form of attack to gain unauthorized access to any system resources. There are criminal statutes governing such activities.
